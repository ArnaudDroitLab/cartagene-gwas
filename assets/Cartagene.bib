  abstract = {Fat content (FC) and fatty acids (FA) are the most important traits in shea tree breeding, controlled by several genes with relatively small effects. Therefore, determining the genes involved in the biosynthesis of such traits is crucial for improving oil quantity and quality and for the domestication process of the species. To identify the quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) controlling FC and FA, we conducted a multi-locus genome-wide association study (GWAS) using six multi-locus GWAS methods for FC and FA in 122 superior shea trees (SSTs). SSTs were genotyped using DArTseq, resulting in 7,559 non-redundant single nucleotide polymorphism markers.},

In population-based cohorts, participants are not recruited for a particular disease but represent a random selection among the population, minimizing the need to correct for bias in measured phenotypes. CaG targeted the segment of the population that is most at risk of developing chronic disorders, that is 40–69 years of age, from four metropolitan areas in Quebec. Over 20 000 participants consented to visiting 1 of 12 assessment sites where detailed health and socio-demographic information, physiological measures and biological samples (blood, serum and urine) were captured for a total of 650 variables. Significant correlations of diseases and chronic conditions are observed across these regions, implicating complex interactions, some of which we describe for major chronic conditions. The CaG study is one of the few population-based cohorts in the world where blood is stored not only for DNA and protein based science but also for gene expression analyses, opening the door for multiple systems genomics approaches that identify genetic and environmental factors associated with disease-related quantitative traits. Interested researchers are encouraged to submit project proposals on the study website (www.cartagene.qc.ca).}

  abstract = {Machine learning holds immense promise in biology, particularly for the challenging task of identifying causal variants for Mendelian and complex traits. Two primary approaches have emerged for this task: supervised sequence-to-function models trained on functional genomics experimental data and self-supervised DNA language models that learn evolutionary constraints on sequences. However, the field currently lacks consistently curated datasets with accurate labels, especially for non-coding variants, that are necessary to comprehensively benchmark these models and advance the field. In this work, we present TraitGym, a curated dataset of regulatory genetic variants that are either known to be causal or are strong candidates across 113 Mendelian and 83 complex traits, along with carefully constructed control variants. We frame the causal variant prediction task as a binary classification problem and benchmark various models, including functional-genomics-supervised models, self-supervised models, models that combine machine learning predictions with curated annotation features, and ensembles of these. Our results provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of different approaches for predicting the functional consequences of non-coding genetic variants. We find that alignment-based models CADD and GPN-MSA compare favorably for Mendelian traits and complex disease traits, while functional-genomics-supervised models Enformer and Borzoi perform better for complex non-disease traits. Evo2 shows substantial performance gains with scale, but still lags somewhat behind alignment-based models, struggling particularly with enhancer variants. The benchmark, including a Google Colab notebook to evaluate a model in a few minutes, is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/songlab/TraitGym.},

  abstract = {Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) hold promise for early disease diagnosis and personalized treatment, but their overall discriminative power remains limited for many diseases in the general population. As a result, numerous novel PRS modeling techniques have been developed to improve predictive performance, but determining the most effective method for a specific application remains uncertain until tested. Hence, we introduce a novel, versatile tool for building an optimized PRS model by integrating candidate models from multiple existing PRS building methods that use target population data and/or incorporating information from other populations through a trans-ethnic approach. Our tool, PNL is based on PairNet algorithm, a Convolutional Neural Network with low computation complexity through simple paring operation. In the case studies for asthma, type 2 diabetes, and vertigo, the optimal PRS model generated with PNL using only Taiwan biobank (TWB) data achieved Area Under the Curves (AUCs) that matched or improved the best results using other methods individually. Incorporating the UK Biobank data (UKBB) data further improved performance of PNL for asthma and type 2 diabetes. For vertigo, unlike the other diseases, individual method analysis showed that UKBB data alone generally produced lower AUCs compared to TWB data alone. As a result, incorporating UKBB data did not improve AUC with PNL, suggesting that increasing the number of candidate models does not necessarily result in higher AUC values, alleviating concerns about overfitting.The python code for PairNet algorithm incorporated in PNL is freely available on: https://github.com/FannLab/pairnet.

Using a whole-genome- and -exome-sequencing data set of 2875 individuals of European ancestry from the Genetics of Type 2 Diabetes (GoT2D) project and a whole-exome-sequencing data set of 13\,000 individuals from five ancestries from the GoT2D and T2D-GENES (Type 2 Diabetes Genetic Exploration by Next-generation sequencing in multi-Ethnic Samples) projects, we describe guidelines for genome- and exome-wide association P-value thresholds needed to correct for multiple testing, explaining the impact of linkage disequilibrium thresholds for distinguishing independent variants, minor allele frequency and ancestry characteristics. We emphasize the advantage of studying recent genetic isolate populations when performing rare and low-frequency genetic association analyses, as the multiple testing burden is diminished due to higher genetic homogeneity.},

  abstract = {By aggregating data for complex traits in a biologically meaningful way, gene and gene-set analysis constitute a valuable addition to single-marker analysis. However, although various methods for gene and gene-set analysis currently exist, they generally suffer from a number of issues. Statistical power for most methods is strongly affected by linkage disequilibrium between markers, multi-marker associations are often hard to detect, and the reliance on permutation to compute p-values tends to make the analysis computationally very expensive. To address these issues we have developed MAGMA, a novel tool for gene and gene-set analysis. The gene analysis is based on a multiple regression model, to provide better statistical performance. The gene-set analysis is built as a separate layer around the gene analysis for additional flexibility. This gene-set analysis also uses a regression structure to allow generalization to analysis of continuous properties of genes and simultaneous analysis of multiple gene sets and other gene properties. Simulations and an analysis of Crohn’s Disease data are used to evaluate the performance of MAGMA and to compare it to a number of other gene and gene-set analysis tools. The results show that MAGMA has significantly more power than other tools for both the gene and the gene-set analysis, identifying more genes and gene sets associated with Crohn’s Disease while maintaining a correct type 1 error rate. Moreover, the MAGMA analysis of the Crohn’s Disease data was found to be considerably faster as well.},

Despite extensive data from consortia like ENCODE, understanding the dynamics of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in gene expression remains challenging. Deep learning is a powerful tool for learning gene expression and epigenomic signals from DNA sequences, exhibiting superior performance compared to conventional machine learning approaches. However, even the most advanced deep learning-based methods may fall short in capturing the regulatory effects of distal elements such as enhancers, limiting their predictive accuracy. In addition, these methods may require significant resources to train or to adapt to newly generated data. To address these challenges, we present EPInformer, a scalable deep-learning framework for predicting gene expression by integrating promoter-enhancer interactions with their sequences, epigenomic signals, and chromatin contacts. Our model outperforms existing gene expression prediction models in rigorous cross-chromosome validation, accurately recapitulates enhancer-gene interactions validated by CRISPR perturbation experiments, and identifies crucial transcription factor motifs within regulatory sequences.

  abstract = {Imputation can cost-effectively generate genotypes for millions of variants. The power of performing rare variant aggregate association tests using imputed genotypes was evaluated. White Europeans from the UK Biobank with exome sequence and genotype array data were analyzed. Using the genotype type array data from the UK Biobank, imputation was performed using the HRC r1.1 (N=64,976 Haplotypes) and TOPMed r3 (N=267,194 haplotypes) reference panels. Simulations were used to compare the power of performing rare variant aggregate association analysis using sequence and imputed data. Additionally, the number of genes with {$>$}2 rare variants (missense, nonsense, splice site) was approximately the same for exome sequence and TOPMed imputed data, but HRC imputed data had ∼10\% fewer genes. For the imputed data, using a less stringent R2 threshold (i.e., {$>$}0.3 vs. {$>$}0.8) led to greater power to detect aggregate associations due to additional rare variants included in the test. Exome sequence data provided the highest power for rare variant aggregate association testing, with TOPMed imputed variants usually having less than a 20\% reduction in power. HRC imputed variants provided substantially less power. We also performed rare variant aggregate association analyses using UK Biobank phenotype, exome sequence data, and imputed variants for PCSK9 and low-density lipoprotein (N=159,904 study subjects) and APOC3 and triglyceride levels (N=160,036 study subjects). For these analyses, even when ultra-rare variants (minor allele frequency{$<$}0.001) were analyzed, significant aggregate associations could be detected for the exome sequence data and TOPMed and HRC imputed variants. Although there is a decrease in power for rare variant aggregate association tests when analyzing imputed variants compared to sequence data due to missing variants and uncertainty in genotypes, analysis of imputed data is a viable approach to detect rare variant aggregate associations when sequence data is unavailable.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have identified connections between genetic variations and diseases, but they only examine a small portion of single nucleotide polymorphisms. To enhance genetic findings, researchers suggest imputing genotypes for unmeasured SNPs to improve coverage and statistical power. When this is not possible, summary statistics imputation can be used as an alternative. The available summary statistics imputation tools rely on reference panels, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, to estimate linkage disequilibrium (LD) between variants for accurate imputation. Tools like FAPI and SSIMP use these reference panels in variant call format (VCF) for this purpose, though this process can be time-consuming. A more effective approach for processing reference panels in summary statistics imputation was proposed in RAISS. In this approach, the LD among the variants is precomputed from the reference panel, prior to imputation, thereby reducing computational time.},

  abstract = {Introduction: When analyzing data from large-scale genetic association studies, such as targeted or genome-wide resequencing studies, it is common to assume a single genetic model, such as dominant or additive, for all tests of association between a given genetic variant and the phenotype. However, for many variants, the chosen model will result in poor model fit and may lack statistical power due to model mis-specification. Objective: We develop power and sample size calculations for tests of gene and gene by environment interaction, allowing for mis-specification of the true mode of genetic susceptibility. Methods: The power calculations are based on a likelihood ratio test framework and are implemented in an open-source R package (“genpwr”). Results: We use these methods to develop an analysis plan for a resequencing study in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and show that using a 2-degree of freedom test can increase power to detect recessive genetic effects while maintaining power to detect dominant and additive effects. Conclusions: Understanding the impact of model mis-specification can aid in study design and developing analysis plans that maximize power to detect a range of true underlying genetic effects. In particular, these calculations help identify when a multiple degree of freedom test or other robust test of association may be advantageous.},

However, currently identified regulatory variants, notably expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), explain only a small fraction of GWAS signals. Here, we show that GWAS and cis-eQTL hits are systematically different: eQTLs cluster strongly near transcription start sites, whereas GWAS hits do not. Genes near GWAS hits are enriched in key functional annotations, are under strong selective constraint and have complex regulatory landscapes across different tissue/cell types, whereas genes near eQTLs are depleted of most functional annotations, show relaxed constraint, and have simpler regulatory landscapes. We describe a model to understand these observations, including how natural selection on complex traits hinders discovery of functionally relevant eQTLs. Our results imply that GWAS and eQTL studies are systematically biased toward different types of variant, and support the use of complementary functional approaches alongside the next generation of eQTL studies.},

La population fondatrice canadienne-française est une population très utile dans les études d'association génétique en raison de sa diversité unique d'haplotypes et de l'excès de variantes rares.

  abstract = {Our knowledge of complex disorders has increased in the last years thanks to the identification of genetic variants (GVs) significantly associated with disease phenotypes by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, we do not understand yet how these GVs functionally impact disease pathogenesis or their underlying biological mechanisms. Among the multiple post-GWAS methods available, fine-mapping and colocalization approaches are commonly used to identify causal GVs, meaning those with a biological effect on the trait, and their functional effects. Despite the variety of post-GWAS tools available, there is no guideline for method eligibility or validity, even though these methods work under different assumptions when accounting for linkage disequilibrium and integrating molecular annotation data. Moreover, there is no benchmarking of the available tools. In this context, we have applied two different fine-mapping and colocalization methods to the same GWAS on major depression (MD) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) datasets. Our goal is to perform a systematic comparison of the results obtained by the different tools. To that end, we have evaluated their results at different levels: fine-mapped and colocalizing GVs, their target genes and tissue specificity according to gene expression information, as well as the biological processes in which they are involved. Our findings highlight the importance of fine-mapping as a key step for subsequent analysis. Notably, the colocalizing variants, altered genes and targeted tissues differed between methods, even regarding their biological implications. This contribution illustrates an important issue in post-GWAS analysis with relevant consequences on the use of GWAS results for elucidation of disease pathobiology, drug target prioritization and biomarker discovery.},

However, before such studies are undertaken, it is important to know what proportion of human genetic variation they are likely to survey and what the likely costs will be per true-positive result.The allelic spectrum of complex diseases — that is, the range of the frequencies and effect sizes of susceptibility loci —will influence the success of genome-wide association studies. Large sample sizes will be required to search even the most accessible end of this spectrum: that is, alleles with population allele frequencies exceeding 0.1 and with odds ratios of 1.3 and above.The existence of extensive regions of linkage disequilibrium in the human genome will greatly reduce the cost of genotyping in genome-wide association studies, as this allows the use of tag SNPs that provide information on a number of other SNPs that are not directly genotyped.However, as much as 30\% of the common variants in the genome remains unknown and the latest high-throughput technologies convert only about 50\% of SNPs into robust assays. In addition, extensive resequencing and genotyping will have to be carried out to ensure that SNPs in regions of low linkage disequilibrium are surveyed comprehensively.Other factors that need to be taken into account in the design and execution of initial genome-wide association studies, to avoid loss of statistical power, include possible selection bias, population substructure and misclassification errors.},

We then benchmarked three popular GWAS tools [generalized linear mixed model associated test (GMMAT), scalable and accurate implementation of generalized mixed model (SAIGE) and Tractor] by computing inflation factors and power calculations under different MAFs, case–control ratios, sample sizes and varying ancestry proportions. We also employed a cohort of Peruvians (N\,=\,249) to further examine the performances of the testing models on (i) real genetic and phenotype data and (ii) small sample sizes.In the synthetic cohort, SAIGE performed better than GMMAT and Tractor in terms of type-I error rate, especially under severe unbalanced case–control ratio. On the contrary, power analysis identified Tractor as the best method to pinpoint ancestry-specific causal variants but showed decreased power when the effect size displayed limited heterogeneity between ancestries. In the Peruvian cohort, only Tractor identified two suggestive loci (P-value \$\textbackslash le 1\textbackslash ast\{10\}\textasciicircum\{-5\}\$) associated with Native American ancestry.The current study illustrates best practice and limitations for available GWAS tools under the scenario of genetic admixture. Incorporating local ancestry in GWAS analyses boosts power, although careful consideration of complex scenarios (small sample sizes, imbalance case–control ratio, MAF heterogeneity) is needed.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of next-generation sequencing technologies and genomic data sharing initiatives during the post-Human Genome Project-era has catalyzed major advances in individualized medicine research. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become a cornerstone of efforts towards understanding the genetic basis of complex diseases, leading to the development of polygenic scores (PGS). Despite their immense potential, the scarcity of standardized PGS development pipelines limits widespread adoption of PGS. Herein, we introduce PGSXplorer, a comprehensive Nextflow DSL2 pipeline that enables quality control of genomic data and automates the phasing, imputation, and construction of PGS models using reference GWAS data. PGSXplorer integrates various PGS development tools such as PLINK, PRSice-2, LD-Pred2, Lassosum2, MegaPRS, SBayesR-C, PRS-CSx and MUSSEL, improving the generalizability of PGS through multi-origin data integration. Tested with synthetic datasets, our fully Docker-encapsulated tool has demonstrated scalability and effectiveness for both single- and multi-population analyses. Continuously updated as an open-source tool, PGSXplorer is freely available with user tutorials at https://github.com/tutkuyaras/PGSXplorer, making it a valuable resource for advancing precision medicine in genetic research.},

  abstract = {Motivation: One major challenge of interpreting variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex traits or diseases is how to efficiently annotate noncoding variants. These variants influence gene expression by disrupting cis-regulatory elements (CREs), whose spatial and cell-type specificity are not adequately captured by conventional tools like multi-marker analysis of genomic annotation. Current methods either rely on linear proximity to genes or quantitative trait locus (QTL) data yet fail to integrate single-cell epigenomic information for a comprehensive annotation. Results: We present SC-VAR, a novel computational tool designed to enhance the interpretation of disease-associated risks from GWAS using single-cell epigenomic data. SC-VAR leverages single-cell epigenomic data to predict functional outcomes including risk genes, pathways, and cell types for both coding and noncoding disease-associated variants. We demonstrate that SC-VAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods by predicting more validated disease-related genes and pathways for multiple diseases. Additionally, SC-VAR identifies cell types that are susceptible to disease, along with their specific CREs and target genes linked to risk. By capturing a broad range of disease risks across human tissues at distinct developmental stages, SC-VAR could enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms in complex tissues across different life stages.},
