Indeed, among the five genome arrays assembled in Section 1.3.2.1, most have been mapped against GRCh37 (hg19), but at least one has been mapped against the recent hg38 (GRCh38, 2013) version, report to page 38 in Pelletier (2022).\nWe definitely do not have the most recent version of CarTaGene (in the paper, around \\(30000\\) samples mentioned, against \\(20000\\) in my database + )\nWhy starting from BAM/BED/BIM pre-processed files in Section 1.3.2.1, instead of FASTQ files available in /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/data/merged? Related question: we use the BAM/BED/BIM files stored in folder /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC for PCA computation in Section 1.3.2.2, but VCF files stored in /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/variants_extraction for running the GWAS analyses, for which reason?\n\nWhy use a biased gene-centric approach, instead of true GWAS (further discussed in Section 1.4.4)?. Specifically, in contrast with the conclusions of this limited study on a single gene, namely HDAC-9, running a whole GWAS analysis on CarTaGene revealed promising and significant SNPs, as illustrated in Figure¬†1.1.\n\nAn alternative to candidate gene association studies relies on the linkage analysis approach, which uses familial pedigrees to map genetic variants underlying common human diseases. This strategy requires both genetic data and detailed family pedigrees., report to for details.\n\n\nAddress intrinsic heterogeneity of the sampled population, see A benchmark study on current GWAS models in admixed populations, from Yang et al. (2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1.1: GWAS of CarTaGene SNPs using TOPMed Merge-Impute (first, merge all genotype arrays, then impute SNPs) strategy. obtained through genotyping and imputation using the TOPMed Imputation Server under two analytic workflows: Impute-Merge and Merge-Impute.

Seems not avalaible anymore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip¬†1.1: Genetic models\n\n\n\n\n\nGenotype: At a given SNP with alleles A (major) and a (minor), the genotypes are:\n\n\nAA (homozygous major)\n\nAa (heterozygous)\n\naa (homozygous minor)\n\n\nPhenotype: A continuous or binary outcome (e.g., height, disease status)\nNotations: \\(Y\\): phenotype, \\(G\\): genotype, \\(\\beta\\): effect size, \\(X\\): covariates (e.g., age, sex, PCs) and \\(\\epsilon\\): error term.\n\n\nüß¨ Genetic Models in GWAS\n\nAdditive model: in Equation¬†1.1, ‚Äògene cat‚Äô is converted as AA = 0, Aa = 1 and aa = 2. Each additional copy of the minor allele increases the trait linearly.\nDominant model: in Equation¬†1.1, ‚Äògene cat‚Äô is converted as AA = 0, Aa = 1 and aa = 1. Presence of at least one minor allele confers full effect (no dose response).\nRecessive model: in Equation¬†1.1, ‚Äògene cat‚Äô is converted as AA = 0, Aa = 0 and aa = 1.

Arrays were merged together using Bash script merge_datasets.sh, and command --bmerge of tool plink2. This command only keeps matching SNPs and alleles across the 5 arrays.\nThe resulting BAM files (sequence alignments), BED files (genomic regions of interest, for viewers), BIM (SNP information) and FAM (phenotype data, such as individuals and pedigree), are listed in folder /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC, with prefix merge_5_* (for 5 genotypes concatenated).\n\n1.3.2.2 Step 2: Preprocessing for Removing Correlated Features\nRemark: the prefix eur_only stands for Caucasian phenotypes.\n\n1.3.2.2.1 i) Trim missing SNPs\n\n\nInputs:\n\n\nPhenotype Ids of white individuals: eur_only/cartagene_self_reported_EUR.plink_format.txt\n\n\nBIM/BED/FAM/hh folder generated with --make-bed command: analyses/QC/merge_5_datasets.

The genotyping rate measures the proportion of successfully genotyped markers and indicates how complete the genotype data is. Removing SNPs with low Genotyping Rate increases Missing Data imputation performance, and overall maintains higher statistical power.\nRemark: Also advised to exclude samples with low Genotyping Rate, below 0.98.\nBash command:\n\nplink2 \\\n  --bfile /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC/merge_5_datasets \\\n  --geno 0.05 \\\n  --keep /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC/eur_only/cartagene_self_reported_EUR.plink_format.txt \\\n  --make-bed \\\n  --out /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC/eur_only/merge_5_datasets.eur_only.geno095\n\n1.3.2.2.2 ii) Hardy-Weinberg Disequilibrium\n\n\nInputs:\n\n\nBIM/BED/FAM/hh (Homozygous-Haplotype) files generated from previous SNP missing removal, see Section 1.3.2.2.1.\n\n\nObjective: Remove SNPs variants with Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium \\(&lt; 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\). Indeed, if a SNP is in HWD, it might reflect hidden sub-population structure or poor-quality rather than true genetic associations.\nRemark: If a SNP is under strong natural selection, such as SNPs involved in the HLA genes, they are likely to deviate from HWE due to balancing selection. If the SNP is biologically important, don‚Äôt exclude it blindly!!

In an ideal population under random mating, allele combinations should be independent (\\(r^2=0\\)). However, due to factors such as genetic drift, or physical proximity, certain alleles tend to be inherited together more often than expected. In GWAS, LD pruning avoids overfitting (SNPs in high LD carry redundant information), avoiding spurious inflation of GWAS association signals.\nRemark: Report the Number of SNPs Before and After Pruning, usually more stringent \\(R^2\\) is considered.\nTool: plink --indep-pairwise 50 5 0.5 will discard SNPs with a correlation coefficient above \\(0.5\\) (given that a \\(R^2\\) score of 1 indicates a perfect correlation), on a rolling window of \\(50\\) SNPs (focus on local zones) and step \\(5\\) by \\(5\\).\nBash command:\n\n## identify SNPs with low LD\nplink2 \\\n  --bfile /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC/eur_only/merge_5_datasets.eur_only.geno095.hwe1e06 \\\n  --indep-pairwise 50 5 0.5 \\\n  --out /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC/eur_only/merge_5_datasets.eur_only.geno095.hwe1e06.pruned_snps\n  \n## save pruned SNPs associated with low LD\nplink2 \\\n  --bfile /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC/eur_only/merge_5_datasets.eur_only.geno095.hwe1e06 \\\n  --extract /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC/eur_only/merge_5_datasets.eur_only.geno095.hwe1e06.pruned_snps.prune.in \\\n  --make-bed \\\n  --out /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC/eur_only/merge_5_datasets.eur_only.geno095.hwe1e06.pruned_snps_bfile\n\n1.3.2.2.3.2 Global LD analysis from prior expert knowledge\n\n\nInputs:\n\n\nBIM/BED/FAM/hh (Homozygous-Haplotype) files merge_5_datasets.eur_only.geno095.hwe1e06.pruned_snps_bfile generated from previous local LD trimming, see Section 1.3.2.2.3.1.\n\n\nObjective: Remove SNPs variants associated with strong linkage disequilibrium using prior expert knowledge, see here for details.1\n\n\n\nBash command:\n\n\nplink2 \\\n  --bfile /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC/eur_only/merge_5_datasets.eur_only.geno095.hwe1e06.pruned_snps_bfile \\\n  --exclude range /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC/high_ld_regions.plink_format.txt \\\n  --make-bed \\\n  --out /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC/eur_only/merge_5_datasets.eur_only.geno095.hwe1e06.pruned_snps.high_LD_excluded\n\n1.3.2.2.4 iv) Exclude affiliated individuals based on high IBD scores\n\n\nInputs:\n\n\nBIM/BED/FAM/hh (Homozygous-Haplotype) files merge_5_datasets.eur_only.geno095.hwe1e06.pruned_snps_bfile generated from previous local LD trimming, see Section 1.3.2.2.3.1.\n\n\nObjective: Exclude related individuals computing identity by descent (IBD), a genetic metric of the relatedness between two individuals, and exclude one individual by pairs of individuals with a score above \\(0.2\\). Indeed, strongly associated patients increase bias in GWAS, raising a stronger score than expected in the general population, and prevents quality controls to detect duplicates or sample mix-ups.\nDetails: A two-step, more stringent IBD filtering strategy has been chosen, eliminating first the most problematic individuals, and the second ensuring the remaining related individuals are properly filtered (for each correlated pair, prune randomly one of them). The Bash instructions are reported here.\nRemarks: Choice of a heuristic threshold of \\(n=68\\) affiliated patients removal to be further discussed. Current score of PI_HAT score of \\(0.2\\) is surprising, as common thresholds are either \\(0.25\\) for discarding grandparent-grandchild, or \\(0.125\\) or lower for only keeping the most distant relatives. Starting from PLINK 2.0, the recommended approach is now utilizing the --king-cutoff command, over the older --rel-cutoff and --genome --min + aggregates all subsequent steps simultaneously, especially in heterogeneous populations2.\nBash command:\n\n\n## Calculate IBD, select individuals with IBD above 0.2 for further pruning\n\nplink2 \\\n  --bfile /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC/eur_only/merge_5_datasets.eur_only.geno095.hwe1e06.pruned_snps_bfile \\\n  --genome \\\n  --memory 12006 \\\n  --min 0.2 \\\n  --out /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC/eur_only/merge_5_datasets.eur_only.geno095.hwe1e06.pruned_snps.IBD\n\n\n## Remove related individuals, in a two-stage process\n\nplink2 \\\n  --bfile /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC/eur_only/merge_5_datasets.eur_only.geno095.hwe1e06.pruned_snps_bfile \\\n  --make-bed \\\n  --out /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC/eur_only/merge_5_datasets.eur_only.geno095.hwe1e06.pruned_snps_bfile.rem_rel_ind_round_1_of_2 \\\n  --remove /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC/eur_only/related_ids/IBD.genome.iids.merged.sorted.count.reverse.ids_related_to_2_individuals.ids_only.FID_IID_format\n\n\nplink2 \\\n  --bfile /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC/eur_only/merge_5_datasets.eur_only.geno095.hwe1e06.pruned_snps_bfile.rem_rel_ind_round_1_of_2 \\\n  --make-bed \\\n  --out /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC/eur_only/merge_5_datasets.eur_only.geno095.hwe1e06.pruned_snps_bfile.rem_rel_ind_round_2_of_2 \\\n  --remove /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/QC/eur_only/related_ids/IBD.genome2.related_individuals_to_remove.txt \n\n1.3.2.3 Step 3: PCA\n\n\nInputs:\n\n\nBIM/BED/FAM/hh (Homozygous-Haplotype) files merge_5_datasets.eur_only.geno095.hwe1e06.pruned_snps.high_LD_excluded resulting from the pre-processing operations reported in Section 1.3.2.2 (LD, HWD and missing SNPs trimming)\n\nphenotype IDs listed in merge_5_datasets.eur_only.geno095.hwe1e06.pruned_snps_bfile.rem_rel_ind_round_2_of_2, where all affiliated patients have been removed.\n\n\nObjective: Compute PCA and keep the 10 first principal components.\nRemark: use visualizations, such as scree plots, elbow point or/and Tracy-Widom Test to select the final number of PCs, instead of hard threshold, and on the other hand, scatter plots to identify latent structures.

Details:\n\nDiscard variants with Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) \\(&lt; 0.01\\) (in other words, the SNP must be present in at least \\(1\\%\\) of the samples).\nSNPs were extracted using bcftools view, with shell script extract_variants.sh8:\n\n\n\nnohup ./shell/extract_variants.sh &gt; shell/extract_variants.log 2&gt;&1 &\n\n\nRemark: --maf guarantees removal of highly recessive SNPs, present in less than \\(1\\%\\) of cases with respect to the dominant form: infrequent SNPs are indeed associated with lower statistical power.\n\n\n1.3.5 Step 3: GWAS Analyses\n\n1.3.5.1 i) GLM and GWAS\n\nObjective: Use of PLINK2 + glm with the first 10 principal components as covariates, see Listing¬†1.6, using logistic regression for categorical variables, and lm for continuous outcomes.\n\nInput:\n\n\nVCF file on the region/gene of interest\nPhenotypes, with individual patient IDs.\nExplanatory variable to predict, provided with --pheno-name &lt;response_variable&gt;.\n\n\n\n\n\nListing¬†1.6\n\nTemplate GLM instruction for GWAS studies:\n\nplink2 \\\n1  --double-id \\ #\n2  --pheno ./phenotypes/merge_phenos_PCs.txt \\ #\n  --pheno-name OSTEOPONIA \\ #\n  --vcf /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/variants_extraction/chr7.merged.clean.noMono.extracted_variants.HDAC9.vcf dosage=HDS #\n3  --glm hide-covar \\ #\n  --covar /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/phenotypes/merge_phenos_PCs.txt \\ #\n  --covar-name PC1,PC2,PC3,PC4,PC5,PC6,PC7,PC8,PC9,PC10 \\ #\n4  --out HDAC9_OSTEOPONIA #\n\n1\n\nThe --double-id option ensures independent GWAS analyses per individual, aka the single-sample mode, stating explicitly that the VCF file follows a family-based format (FID/IID pairs).\n\n2\n\nGWAS inputs: We need the phenotype information (provided with --pheno and --keep commands), the variable to predict (provided with --pheno-name) and the VCF file (command --vcf), here using the SNPs annotations for the HDAC9 gene9.\n\n3\n\nGWAS model options: --glm is the general linear model, which uses by default a logistic regression for categorical variables, and a standard linear Gaussian model, equivalent to lm for continuous variables10. --covar is the covariate file, with relevant explanatory variables to integrate reported with --covar-name (see @ for details). PCAs are used to describe the population structure in an unsupervised manner; and avoid and detect latent subgroups.\n\n4\n\nThe output GWAS folder, with --out command. Stored for now in /mnt/projects_tn01/Cartagene/analyses/association.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, run the plink2_gwas.sh script in the background (possibility to customise gene name and feature variables to regress on):\n## Run the GWAS pipeline in the background,\n## persist after logout, and log everything.\n\nnohup ./shell/plink2_gwas.sh &gt; shell/plink2_gwas.log 2&gt;&1 &\n\nRemark 1: you may come up with Error: Cannot proceed with --glm regression on phenotype 'TACAIX', since variance inflation factor for covariate 'PC2' is too high. In this case, you may try removing completely covariates (with --glm allow-no-covars), or/and increase variance inflation threshold (--vif number_vif option)11\nRemark 2: All the pre-processing operations detailed in Section 1.3.2.2 are only used for the computation of the PCA components, but not subsequently used in the glm regression for trimming strongly correlated features.\nRemark 3: Add phenotype covariates, such as SEX or AGE in the regression framework, which can play a strong leverage on the impact of SNPs. GENESIS is a R package mixing environmental and genetic factors in a fixed linear model approach.\n\n1.3.5.2 ii) GWAS Visualisations\nFor each gene-phenotype pair, we generate cognate Manhattan plots12, and \\(p\\)-values distributions, using histograms13, and QQplots14. Core function for generating these 3 GWAS visualisations is generate_gwas_per_phenotype. An example for gene HDAC-9 is provided in Figure¬†1.3.\n\nCode## p-value adjustment\n## genename &lt;- \"HDAC-9\"; pheno_label &lt;- \"OSTEOPONIA\"; filedate &lt;- \"2025-04-07\"\nnum_variants &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"./tables/HDAC-9/HDAC-9_AVCGLOBAL_PRE_M_2025-04-07.AVCGLOBAL_PRE_M.glm.logistic.hybrid\", show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt; nrow()\npval_threshold &lt;- 0.05/(num_variants*length(cartagene_response_variables$Features))\n## pval_threshold &lt;- 0.01/num_variants\n\ngwas_plots_hdac &lt;- lapply(cartagene_response_variables$Features, \n                          function(feature_label) generate_gwas_per_phenotype (genename = \"HDAC-9\",\n                                                                               pheno_label = feature_label, filedate=\"2025-04-07\", pval_threshold = 0.001)) \n\ngwas_plots_hdac &lt;- gridExtra::marrangeGrob(gwas_plots_hdac, nrow=1, ncol=1)\n\nggsave(\"figures/gwas_HDAC9.pdf\",\n       gwas_plots_hdac, dpi = 600,\n       width = 8, height = 12) \n\n\n\n\nDownload PDF file.\n\n\nFigure¬†1.3\n\n\n\n1.3.5.3 iii) Multiple test correction\nTo compute the adjusted significance threshold, we applied a FWER-like approach, conventional in the GWAS field: {r} 0.05/(num_variants*length(cartagene_response_variables$Features)), in which you divide the pre-defined threshold (standard: 0.05) by the total number of pairwise tests carried out (number of variants times number of regression variables times). Final threshold is accordingly: 2.1188236^{-6}, as 2622 variants were extracted, and 9 phenotype variables were predicted.\nThe FWER approach is particularly conservative, in other words, only the most significant differences are detected.\n\n\nPerspectives:\n\n\nRecent Adjusted \\(p\\)-value correction method.\n\nMultiple Comparisons Using R, comprehensive resource of distinct R package strategies for correcting for multiplicity of \\(p\\)-values, from Bretz, Hothorn, and Westfall (2016). Report also to Note¬†1.1 for an overview of existing approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote¬†1.1: Classes of Multiple Test correction approaches\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple comparison procedures (MCPs) can be classified into the following adjustment methods:\n\nFixed sequential: no adjustment as long as H0s are rejected. One non-rejection and it stops testing with all others non-rejected.\nCallback: significance level (e.g.¬†0.05) is split between all hypotheses (can be further weighted). With rejection of the subsequent H0s, their fractions of significance level is accumulated and passed to the next comparison.\nGatekeeper: serial, parallel & combined trees, collecting hypotheses into families. Groups of testing can be interpreted as gatekeepers: only if any \\(H_0\\) in a family is rejected that the significance is propagated to the next family. The approach is the most versatile, and can be flexibly implemented in R package gMCPLite. See also Graphical Approaches to Multiple Test Problems, for additional details.",

(2023), suggest extending extraction of genomic regions of interest beyond coding sequences (report to Section 1.3.4 for current approach). Indeed, the article demonstrates that most of identified signals originate from nearby gene regulatory sites.\nEPInformer: a scalable deep learning framework for gene expression prediction by integrating promoter-enhancer sequences with multimodal epigenomic data, from Lin, Luo, and Pinello (2024). Avalaible as a GH package.

Several approaches to that end have been implemented:\n\nGnanaolivu et al. (2025) proposed in A clinical knowledge graph-based framework to prioritize candidate genes for facilitating diagnosis of Mendelian diseases and rare genetic conditions, the phenotype prioritization and analysis for rare diseases, PPAR algorithm to rank genes based on human phenotype ontology (HPO) terms.15. In details, PPAR combines embeddings from the human knowledge graph, incorporating genes, HPO terms, and gene ontology annotations connections. For each input HPO term, a prioritized list of genes is returned based on their relevance and similarity to the HPO term.\nBridges et al. (2025) developed in Towards a standard benchmark for phenotype-driven variant and gene prioritisation algorithms: PhEval, Phenotypic inference Evaluation framework a unified benchmarking platform to clean inputs for phenotype-driven VGPAs. Variant and Gene Prioritisation Algorithms integrate complex and multi-modal datasets, such as ontologies and gene-to-phenotype associations, to predict the most influential and promising gene targets controlling the evolution of rare diseases.

(2025). Under the hood, relies on the brms R package.\n\n1.4.6 Post-GWAS: Polygenic risk scores\n\nOptimizing and benchmarking polygenic risk scores with GWAS summary statistics, from Z. Zhao et al. (2024).\nXPRS: A Tool for Interpretable and Explainable Polygenic Risk Score, from Kim and Lee (2025), is a R package for inferring the polygenic risk score for assessing genetic susceptibility to diseases, providing additional interpretation and visualisation tools. PRSs are further split and classified into genes and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) contribution scores via Shapley additive explanations (SHAPs), visualised as Manhattan plots, LocusZoom-like plots and tables at the population and individual levels.\nPNL: a software to build polygenic risk scores using a Super Learner approach based on PairNet, a Convolutional Neural Network, from Chen et al. (2025).\n\n1.4.7 Post-GWAS: Orthogonal integration\n\n1.4.7.1 Epigenomic\n\n\nG. Zhao and Lai (2025) implements SC-VAR: a computational tool for interpreting polygenic disease risks using single-cell epigenomic data, a novel computational tool available as a GitHub repo and Python application: SC-VAR GitHub. SC-VAR uses single-cell epigenomic data to predict functional outcomes of the identified disease-associated GWAS variants, enhancing their interpretability. Under the hood, relies on MAGMA linear modelling framework, developed by Leeuw et al.

Besides, note that --covar passes quantitative covariates (e.g., age, PCs), while --ide-covar passes categorical covariates‚Ü©Ô∏é\nNote that a VIF factor above 10 is considered problematic as it can significantly distort regression estimates. Discussion and visualisations on VIF influence. Briefly, VIF quantifies the degree of similarity across predictor variables, as the GLM-family usually assumes independence between explanatory variables. When VIF is significant, independence assumption is discarded, which might be explained by the fact that preprocessing in Section 1.3.2.2 for removing correlated SNps and individuals are not used in subsequent GWAS differential downstream analyses.‚Ü©Ô∏é\nMore customisation available in Manhattan plot in R: a review‚Ü©Ô∏é\nHow to interpret a \\(p\\)-value histogram‚Ü©Ô∏é\nHow I Make QQ Plots Using ggplot2?‚Ü©Ô∏é\nNote that relying on HPO terms, for example, HP:0004322 ‚Äì Osteopenia, would alleviate the need for standardising phenotype labels, using universally acknowledged scientific terms instead.‚Ü©Ô∏é",
