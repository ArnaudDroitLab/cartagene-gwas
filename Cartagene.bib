  abstract = {Fat content (FC) and fatty acids (FA) are the most important traits in shea tree breeding, controlled by several genes with relatively small effects. Therefore, determining the genes involved in the biosynthesis of such traits is crucial for improving oil quantity and quality and for the domestication process of the species. To identify the quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) controlling FC and FA, we conducted a multi-locus genome-wide association study (GWAS) using six multi-locus GWAS methods for FC and FA in 122 superior shea trees (SSTs). SSTs were genotyped using DArTseq, resulting in 7,559 non-redundant single nucleotide polymorphism markers.},

  abstract = {Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) hold promise for early disease diagnosis and personalized treatment, but their overall discriminative power remains limited for many diseases in the general population. As a result, numerous novel PRS modeling techniques have been developed to improve predictive performance, but determining the most effective method for a specific application remains uncertain until tested. Hence, we introduce a novel, versatile tool for building an optimized PRS model by integrating candidate models from multiple existing PRS building methods that use target population data and/or incorporating information from other populations through a trans-ethnic approach. Our tool, PNL is based on PairNet algorithm, a Convolutional Neural Network with low computation complexity through simple paring operation. In the case studies for asthma, type 2 diabetes, and vertigo, the optimal PRS model generated with PNL using only Taiwan biobank (TWB) data achieved Area Under the Curves (AUCs) that matched or improved the best results using other methods individually. Incorporating the UK Biobank data (UKBB) data further improved performance of PNL for asthma and type 2 diabetes. For vertigo, unlike the other diseases, individual method analysis showed that UKBB data alone generally produced lower AUCs compared to TWB data alone. As a result, incorporating UKBB data did not improve AUC with PNL, suggesting that increasing the number of candidate models does not necessarily result in higher AUC values, alleviating concerns about overfitting.The python code for PairNet algorithm incorporated in PNL is freely available on: https://github.com/FannLab/pairnet. An archived, citable version is stored on: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14838227.},

  abstract = {Diagnosing Mendelian and rare genetic conditions requires identifying phenotype-associated genetic findings and prioritizing likely disease-causing genes. This task is labor-intensive for molecular and clinical geneticists, who must review extensive literature and databases to link patient phenotypes with causal genotypes. The challenge is further complicated by the large number of genetic variants detected through next-generation sequencing, which impacts both diagnosis timelines and patient care strategies. To address this, in silico methods that prioritize causal genes based on patient-derived phenotypes offer an effective solution, reducing the time involved in diagnostic case reviews and enhancing the efficiency of clinical diagnosis.},

There are several challenges in detecting G\,×\,E interactions for censored survival outcomes, such as the high dimensionality, complexity of environmental effects, and specificity of survival analysis. The effect heredity, which incorporates the dependence of the main effects and interactions in the analysis, has been widely applied in the study of interaction detection. However, it has not yet been applied to Bayesian Cox proportional hazards models for detecting interactions for censored survival outcomes.},
