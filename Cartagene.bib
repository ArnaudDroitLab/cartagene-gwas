  abstract = {Fat content (FC) and fatty acids (FA) are the most important traits in shea tree breeding, controlled by several genes with relatively small effects. Therefore, determining the genes involved in the biosynthesis of such traits is crucial for improving oil quantity and quality and for the domestication process of the species. To identify the quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) controlling FC and FA, we conducted a multi-locus genome-wide association study (GWAS) using six multi-locus GWAS methods for FC and FA in 122 superior shea trees (SSTs). SSTs were genotyped using DArTseq, resulting in 7,559 non-redundant single nucleotide polymorphism markers.},

However, the performance of VGPAs has been difficult to measure and is impacted by many factors, for example, ontology structure, annotation completeness or changes to the underlying algorithm. Assertions of the capabilities of VGPAs are often not reproducible, in part because there is no standardised, empirical framework and openly available patient data to assess the efficacy of VGPAs—ultimately hindering the development of effective prioritisation tools.},

  abstract = {Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) hold promise for early disease diagnosis and personalized treatment, but their overall discriminative power remains limited for many diseases in the general population. As a result, numerous novel PRS modeling techniques have been developed to improve predictive performance, but determining the most effective method for a specific application remains uncertain until tested. Hence, we introduce a novel, versatile tool for building an optimized PRS model by integrating candidate models from multiple existing PRS building methods that use target population data and/or incorporating information from other populations through a trans-ethnic approach. Our tool, PNL is based on PairNet algorithm, a Convolutional Neural Network with low computation complexity through simple paring operation. In the case studies for asthma, type 2 diabetes, and vertigo, the optimal PRS model generated with PNL using only Taiwan biobank (TWB) data achieved Area Under the Curves (AUCs) that matched or improved the best results using other methods individually. Incorporating the UK Biobank data (UKBB) data further improved performance of PNL for asthma and type 2 diabetes. For vertigo, unlike the other diseases, individual method analysis showed that UKBB data alone generally produced lower AUCs compared to TWB data alone. As a result, incorporating UKBB data did not improve AUC with PNL, suggesting that increasing the number of candidate models does not necessarily result in higher AUC values, alleviating concerns about overfitting.The python code for PairNet algorithm incorporated in PNL is freely available on: https://github.com/FannLab/pairnet. An archived, citable version is stored on: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14838227.},

  abstract = {The polygenic risk score (PRS) is an important method for assessing genetic susceptibility to diseases; however, its clinical utility is limited by a lack of interpretability tools. To address this problem, we introduce eXplainable PRS (XPRS), an interpretation and visualization tool that decomposes PRSs into genes/regions and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) contribution scores via Shapley additive explanations (SHAPs), which provide insights into specific genes and SNPs that significantly contribute to the PRS of an individual. This software features a multilevel visualization approach, including Manhattan plots, LocusZoom-like plots and tables at the population and individual levels, to highlight important genes and SNPs. By implementing with a user-friendly web interface, XPRS allows for straightforward data input and interpretation. By bridging the gap between complex genetic data and actionable clinical insights, XPRS can improve communication between clinicians and patients.The XPRS software is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/nayeonkim93/XPRS and can see the demo through our cloud-based web service at https://xprs.leelabsg.org/Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {By aggregating data for complex traits in a biologically meaningful way, gene and gene-set analysis constitute a valuable addition to single-marker analysis. However, although various methods for gene and gene-set analysis currently exist, they generally suffer from a number of issues. Statistical power for most methods is strongly affected by linkage disequilibrium between markers, multi-marker associations are often hard to detect, and the reliance on permutation to compute p-values tends to make the analysis computationally very expensive. To address these issues we have developed MAGMA, a novel tool for gene and gene-set analysis. The gene analysis is based on a multiple regression model, to provide better statistical performance. The gene-set analysis is built as a separate layer around the gene analysis for additional flexibility. This gene-set analysis also uses a regression structure to allow generalization to analysis of continuous properties of genes and simultaneous analysis of multiple gene sets and other gene properties. Simulations and an analysis of Crohn’s Disease data are used to evaluate the performance of MAGMA and to compare it to a number of other gene and gene-set analysis tools. The results show that MAGMA has significantly more power than other tools for both the gene and the gene-set analysis, identifying more genes and gene sets associated with Crohn’s Disease while maintaining a correct type 1 error rate. Moreover, the MAGMA analysis of the Crohn’s Disease data was found to be considerably faster as well.},

  abstract = {Most signals in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex traits implicate noncoding genetic variants with putative gene regulatory effects. However, currently identified regulatory variants, notably expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), explain only a small fraction of GWAS signals. Here, we show that GWAS and cis-eQTL hits are systematically different: eQTLs cluster strongly near transcription start sites, whereas GWAS hits do not. Genes near GWAS hits are enriched in key functional annotations, are under strong selective constraint and have complex regulatory landscapes across different tissue/cell types, whereas genes near eQTLs are depleted of most functional annotations, show relaxed constraint, and have simpler regulatory landscapes. We describe a model to understand these observations, including how natural selection on complex traits hinders discovery of functionally relevant eQTLs. Our results imply that GWAS and eQTL studies are systematically biased toward different types of variant, and support the use of complementary functional approaches alongside the next generation of eQTL studies.},

  abstract = {Motivation: One major challenge of interpreting variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex traits or diseases is how to efficiently annotate noncoding variants. These variants influence gene expression by disrupting cis-regulatory elements (CREs), whose spatial and cell-type specificity are not adequately captured by conventional tools like multi-marker analysis of genomic annotation. Current methods either rely on linear proximity to genes or quantitative trait locus (QTL) data yet fail to integrate single-cell epigenomic information for a comprehensive annotation. Results: We present SC-VAR, a novel computational tool designed to enhance the interpretation of disease-associated risks from GWAS using single-cell epigenomic data. SC-VAR leverages single-cell epigenomic data to predict functional outcomes including risk genes, pathways, and cell types for both coding and noncoding disease-associated variants. We demonstrate that SC-VAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods by predicting more validated disease-related genes and pathways for multiple diseases. Additionally, SC-VAR identifies cell types that are susceptible to disease, along with their specific CREs and target genes linked to risk. By capturing a broad range of disease risks across human tissues at distinct developmental stages, SC-VAR could enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms in complex tissues across different life stages.},
