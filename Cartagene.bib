  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used to identify genetic variation associated with complex traits. Despite its success and popularity, the traditional GWAS approach comes with a variety of limitations. For this reason, newer methods for GWAS have been developed, including the use of pan-genomes instead of a reference genome and the utilization of markers beyond single-nucleotide polymorphisms, such as structural variations and k-mers. The k-mers-based GWAS approach has especially gained attention from researchers in recent years. However, these new methodologies can be complicated and challenging to implement. Here, we present kGWASflow, a modular, user-friendly, and scalable workflow to perform GWAS using k-mers. We adopted an existing kmersGWAS method into an easier and more accessible workflow using management tools like Snakemake and Conda and eliminated the challenges caused by missing dependencies and version conflicts. kGWASflow increases the reproducibility of the kmersGWAS method by automating each step with Snakemake and using containerization tools like Docker. The workflow encompasses supplemental components such as quality control, read-trimming procedures, and generating summary statistics. kGWASflow also offers post-GWAS analysis options to identify the genomic location and context of trait-associated k-mers. kGWASflow can be applied to any organism and requires minimal programming skills. kGWASflow is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/akcorut/kGWASflow) and Bioconda (https://anaconda.org/bioconda/kgwasflow).},
